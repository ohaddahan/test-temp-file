## [Test Temp File](https://crates.io/crates/test-temp-file) ![Rust](https://github.com/ohaddahan/test-temp-file/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

This crate allows creation and automatic deletion (based on Drop trait) of files.

This is aimed mostly for testing purposes, for example when testing a parser you probably
want to read/write file and validate their content
